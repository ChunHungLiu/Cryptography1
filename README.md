## HW1 Breaking a Many Time Pad
Given 10 ciphertext that are encrypted using the same pad, decrypt the target ciphertext. XOR the ciphertexts together, and consider what happens when a space is XORed with a character in [a-zA-Z].

## HW2 AES
Use Crypto++ (C++) library to implement AES in CBC mode and CTR mode.

## HW3 SHA256
Use SHA256 to hash a large video files

## HW4 Padding oracle attack
Experiment with a padding oracle attack against a toy web site hosted at crypto-class.appspot.com

## HW5 Math with larget numbers
